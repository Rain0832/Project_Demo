### ABC Mail Order Grocery Store Ordering Program

- The artichokes sold at ABC Mail Order Grocery Store are priced at $2.05 per pound, beets at $1.15 per pound, and carrots at $1.09 per pound. 
- Before adding shipping fees, orders above $100 have a 5% discount. 
- Orders weighing less than or equal to 5 pounds will incur a shipping and packaging fee of $6.5, orders weighing between 5 and 20 pounds will incur a shipping and packaging fee of $14, and orders weighing over 20 pounds will incur an additional $0.5 for each additional pound on top of $14. 
- Write a program that uses a switch statement in a loop to achieve different responses when users input different letters. 
- The response for entering a is to ask the user to input the weight of artichokes, b is the weight of beets, c is the weight of carrots, and q is to exit the order. 
- The program needs to record the accumulated weight. 
- That is, if the user inputs a 4-pound beet and then inputs a 5-pound beet, the program should report a 9-pound beet. 
- Then, the program needs to calculate the total price of the goods, discounts (if any), shipping and packaging fees. 
- Subsequently, the program should display all purchase information: item price, ordered weight (in pounds), cost of ordered vegetables, total cost of order, discount (if any), shipping and packaging fees, and total cost of all expenses.

### ABC邮购商店订货系统程序

- ABC邮购杂货店出售的洋蓟售价为2.05美元/磅，甜菜售价为1.15美元/磅，胡萝卜售价为1.09美元/磅。
- 在添加运费之前，100美元以上的订单有5%的打折优惠。少于或等于5磅的订单收取6.5美元的运费和包装费，5磅-20磅的订单收取14美元的运费和包装费，超过20磅的订单在14美元吗的基础上每续1磅增加0.5美元。
- 编写一个程序，在循环中用switch语句实现用户输入不同的字母时有不同的响应，即输入a的响应是让用户输入洋蓟的磅数，b是甜菜的磅数，c是胡萝卜的磅数，q是退出订购。
- 程序要记录累计的重量。
- 即，如果用户输入4磅的甜菜，然后输入5磅的甜菜，程序应该报告9磅的甜菜。
- 然后，该程序要计算货物总价、折扣（如果有的话）、运费和包装费。
- 随后，程序应显示所有的购买信息：物品售价、订购的重量（单位：磅）、订购的蔬菜费用、订单的总费用、折扣（如果有的话）、运费和包装费、以及所有的费用总额。
